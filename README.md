# EMvidence

## Overview

EMvidence is a software tool for extracting forensic insights from electromagnetic (EM) signals emitted by IoT devices. It leverages Software-defined Radio (SDR) hardware, specifically the HackRF One, to capture, preprocess, and analyze EM signals, offering an alternative to traditional invasive digital forensic methods.

## Key Features

- **EM Signal Capture**: Uses HackRF One to collect signals from IoT devices.
- **Signal Analysis**: Provides modules for preprocessing and analyzing captured EM data.
- **Extensibility**: Supports third-party module development for custom preprocessing and analysis.
- **Forensic Alternative**: Non-invasive solution for IoT device investigations.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML, Material UI, React
- **Backend**: Laravel, MySQL
